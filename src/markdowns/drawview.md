**the idea:** 

I'm trying to make an app that will help you learn to draw. 

<br>

**note:** 

turns out this app idea has been done before, but I'll just make a better version.

the code on GitHub is with developing it with expo. I have a React Native version, but it's somehow too big to be uploaded.

<br>

**what I have now:**

- animated home screen
- access to camera
- able to get image from storage and overlay it over the camera
- use the accelerometer to detect phone tilt, to angle the image such that it will remain parallel with the paper
- user can change the opacity and scale of the image 

<br>

**what I want to do:**

- add an edge detection so it actually plants the image on the paper and not just have it floating there

<br>

**problems:**

- trying to learn how to use a live edge detection API
