**note:**

the file uploaded is not the final product, rather the most recent version I managed to recover.

**the idea:** 

*Kohina!Run* is a RPG, where the player plays as a girl whose ultimate goal is to make a bowl of noodles. 

This game was completed through the collaborative efforts between myself and two other members of my group. We managed to draw and color all the sprites and backgrounds, code, test, debug, and ultimately finish this game.

The player must find all the ingredients, interact with the environment, and complete a series of mini-games.

**my contributions:**

- all player movement and animation
- collision detection
- player inventory management
- saving and loading save-files
- one mini-game: "cooking"
- colour assets and interface design
- successfully lead a team of three to ensure project deadlines were met
- learned the process of the software development cycle to optimize our time and ensure a high-quality game
- developed, tested, integrated and debugged code  to guarantee smooth and bug-free gameplay
