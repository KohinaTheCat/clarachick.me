`Kohina!Run` is an RPG, where the player plays as a girl whose ultimate goal is to make a bowl of noodles. 

This game was completed through the collaborative efforts between myself and two other members of my group. We managed to draw and color all the sprites and backgrounds, code, test, debug, and ultimately finish this game.

The player must find all the ingredients, interact with the environment, and complete a series of mini-games.
