**the idea:** 

in a group of three, use the Agile Scrum software development process to create a mock shell, to use with a mock file system. 

<br>

**commands supported:** 

you may redirect output to a file using `>` and `>>`

`cat` 

`cd` 

`cp` 

`curl` -   retrieves a file/raw HTML at a URL and add it to the current working directory

`echo`

`find`

`history`

`load` - load save file

`ls`

`man`

`mkdir`

`mv`

`popd` - change working directory to the first directory on the stack

`pushd` - add current working directory to the stack, and change it to the specified directory

`pwd`

`rm`

`save` - save current state of the filesystem and shell into a `.ser` file

`speak` - converts text to audio

`tree`
